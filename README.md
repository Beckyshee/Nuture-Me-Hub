Online Mother Record System
Empowering Maternal Healthcare through Digital Transformation
About:
The Online Mother Record System is a groundbreaking initiative designed to revolutionize maternal healthcare by replacing traditional paper-based systems with a digitalized approach. Targeting first-time mothers, healthcare professionals, and administrative staff, our project aims to streamline antenatal care processes, enhance data accessibility, and empower mothers through timely reminders and comprehensive record-keeping. Traditional methods of managing mother records during antenatal clinics often suffer from inefficiencies, including delays in accessing information, errors in data entry, and the risk of losing the essential mother-baby book. These challenges can significantly impact the quality of healthcare services provided to mothers and infants.
Team:
Frontend Developer: Kelvin
Role: Kelvin will focus on developing the user interface and user experience components of the online mother record system. He will work closely with the design team to implement responsive and intuitive front-end features.
Backend Developer & QA Tester: Rebecca Kariuki
Role: Rebecca will be responsible for the server-side development, database management, and creation of the APIs. She will work closely with the front-end team to ensure seamless integration. She will also be doing the testing as integration continues for smooth progress.
DevOps Engineer & Database Management: Satha  Osman Gesey
Role: Satha will be responsible for implementing DevOps practices to streamline development, testing, and deployment processes. This includes setting up continuous integration, continuous deployment, and managing the database.

Technologies:
Programming Language:
Chosen Technology: JavaScript, TypeScript
Alternative Option: Python
Decision Rationale: JavaScript and TypeScript were chosen for their versatility and wide adoption. They provide a robust ecosystem for frontend and backend development, and TypeScript adds static typing for enhanced code quality.
Backend:
Chosen Technology: Node.js with TypeScript
Alternative Option: Flask
Decision Rationale: Node.js with TypeScript was chosen for its compatibility with JavaScript, making it a seamless transition. It offers a non-blocking, event-driven architecture suitable for scalable applications. Flask, while suitable for Python enthusiasts, didn't align as well with the overall project requirements.
Database Management System:
Chosen Technology: MySQL
Alternative Option: PostgreSQL
Decision Rationale: MySQL was chosen for its ease of use and speed, which aligns well with the project's focus on fast and efficient healthcare processes. However, it's crucial to note that MySQL was chosen over PostgreSQL due to specific project requirements. PostgreSQL might be a more suitable option for projects with more complex data relationships.
Frontend Framework:
Chosen Technology: Vanilla JS
Alternative Option: Angular
Decision Rationale: Vanilla JS (JavaScript without additional frameworks) was chosen for its simplicity and lightweight nature, aligning with the project's goal of a straightforward front end. React.js, which was initially chosen, is a more feature-rich library, but for the sake of simplicity and a modular approach, Vanilla JS was preferred over Angular.
enable front end, essential for the scalability and adaptability goals of the project.
Challenges:
Problem to Solve:
The Online Mother Record System addresses the inefficiencies of traditional paper-based systems in managing maternal records during antenatal clinics. It aims to eliminate delays, errors, and the loss of the mother-baby book, ensuring better healthcare services. The project also empowers mothers with reminders for baby vaccinations and note-taking for doctor recommendations, especially in cases of growth issues affecting the baby.
What the Portfolio Project Will Not Solve:
While focusing on digitizing and streamlining maternal health records, the project does not address broader healthcare system issues such as resource allocation or the need for skilled healthcare professionals.
Users and Beneficiaries:
The system benefits first-time mothers by eliminating the need for physical records during checkups. Healthcare professionals, including obstetricians, nurses, midwives, and administrative staff, experience streamlined workflows, enhanced data accessibility, and improved collaboration. Expectant mothers gain better access to their health information, reminders for vaccinations, and the ability to record doctor recommendations.
Relevance to Locale:
Tailored to the Kenyan context, the system aligns with local healthcare regulations and practices. It addresses unique challenges, offering scalability and adaptability for diverse healthcare facilities within the country.
Risks:
Data Security Breach:
Potential Impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive records.
Safeguards/Alternatives: Robust encryption, regular security audits, access controls, and staff training.
System Downtime:
Potential Impact: Interruption of services affecting patient care.
Safeguards/Alternatives: Redundant servers, regular maintenance, and a comprehensive backup and disaster recovery plan.
Integration Issues:
Potential Impact: Incompatibility with existing hospital systems.
Safeguards/Alternatives: Thorough compatibility assessments, involving IT experts in the integration process.
Scalability Challenges:
Potential Impact: Inability to handle increasing data volume and user load.
Safeguards/Alternatives: Designing the system with scalability in mind, periodic assessment, and upgrading of infrastructure.
Infrastructure:
Branching and Merging:
Following the Gitflow branching model to distinguish feature, release, and main branches ensures organized development, code reviews, and stable releases.
Deployment Strategy:
Utilizing CI/CD practices ensures automated testing, staging deployment, and production deployment with containerization for environment consistency.
Data Population:
Dummy data generated from APIs and manual input during integration and testing phases populate the application for development and testing purposes.
Testing Tools and Automation:
Frontend Testing (UI): Cypress for end-to-end testing.
API Testing: Postman for API testing.
Unit Testing: Jest for testing controllers.
Integration Testing: Leveraging testing frameworks compatible with the chosen backend technology. Automation in the CI/CD pipeline ensures early issue detection and a stable application.
Existing Solutions:
Electronic Health Record (EHR) Systems:
Similarities: Digitising patient health records.
Differences: Our system focuses specifically on maternal health, providing tailored features for healthcare professionals.
Maternal Health Apps:
Similarities: Provide pregnancy tracking and health record-keeping.
Differences: Our system is comprehensive for healthcare professionals, integrating with hospital systems and offering advanced features.
Rationale for Reimplementation:
The decision to reimplement stems from the need for a specialized, efficient system dedicated to maternal health within a hospital setting. Existing solutions may lack features specific to obstetrics or seamless integration into hospital workflows. The reimplemented solution aims for a focused, user-friendly experience, considering hospital requirements and scalability.
